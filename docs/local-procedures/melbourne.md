## Melbourne Airport


## Avalon Airport


## Moorabbin Airport
Moorabbin Aiport is a Class Delta airspace. The aerodrome is the busiest training airport in Australia, therefore it's local procedures are very pilot dependent, and rely on pilots following local inbound and outbound procedures to maintain smooth operation.

### Ground Procedures
On the ground, aircraft in the apron bays may start up and taxi their aircraft without having to recieve a start or taxi clearance. Aircraft will then follow taxiways to the Northern or Southern runup bays.
Once runups are complete, an aircraft can call for taxi to either runway in use, as well as stating the following call, including, who you are, what aircraft you are in, where you are, where you want to taxi to and how you want to depart.

`Moorabbin Ground, VCY, Cessna 152, Southern Runup bay, request taxi runway 17R, upwind departure to the training area, in receipt of Uniform.`
